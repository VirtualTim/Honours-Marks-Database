Welcome to the Honours Marks Database!

This program was developed by Nicholas Abbey, Timothy Lander, Jonathon Chua, Kian (Johnathon) Lim, and Sam Widenbar
for use as a database for marks, for the ANHB honours course at UWA.
This program's directory contains the <<<executable?>>>, the data pertinent to the running of the program, and the
databases containing each cohort's marks. These folders and files should NOT be edited or moved.


While running this program should be intuitive and easy to learn, this readme document has been included
to help you get started with it.

To start the program, <<<run the executable?>>>. The default username and password have been set to 'Heather' and
'default', which can be changed under settings once you've logged in. We recommend you change the password upon
the first time running the program. Next, a database of marks can be chosen from the drop-down list. Each database
is to hold the marks for a separate cohort. The first database(2014, starting in semester 1) has already been made,
and is ready to be opened. This database has been loaded with an initial set of courses, units, and assessments,
based on the honours handbook entry for the physiology and anatomy courses.


There are a number of pages to the program: view reports, edit data, add marks, and settings.

There are several types of reports of data which can be viewed under the reports section, consisting of:
- Review by students
- Review by markers
- Review by course, or
- Review by <<cohort?>>

Review by students shows a list of students, and allows you to view that student's enrolled discipline, his
units, and his marks for all of the assessments and subassessments in those units.
Review by markers shows a list of all the individual marks a marker has given for subassessments, and which
students recieved those marks.
Review by course shows how the entire cohort is performing <<<what is there?>>>

Add marks allows you to add individual sub assessment marks from multiple markers to the database. These will then
generate the overall marks for the relevant sub assessments and assessments. We also have the functionality of
omitting marks when they fall outside of a 2-standard-deviation range from the average mark given to a student
for that sub assessment from all markers. <<<we should pop up a warning to say when that happens?>>>

<<<Edit data does what?>>>

Settings allows you to edit the username and password of the database. <<<what other settings are there?>>>
